/*
There are two ways to create a React component. 
The first way is to use a JavaScript function. 
Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. 
The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. 
For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.
To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. 
One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. 
This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. 
It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. 
This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.
