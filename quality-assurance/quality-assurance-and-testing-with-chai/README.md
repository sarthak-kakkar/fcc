As your programs become more complex, you need to test them often to make sure any new code you add doesn't break the program's original functionality. Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you check that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes. Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

test('#isTrue, #isNotTrue', function(){
      assert.isTrue( true, 'true is true');
      assert.isTrue( !!'double negation', 'double negation of a truthy is true');
      assert.isNotTrue({ value: 'truthy' }, 'A truthy object is NOT TRUE (neither is false...)' );
    });

Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.

A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. This kind of tool is particularly useful for testing web pages, as it is able to render and understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the same way a browser would.
