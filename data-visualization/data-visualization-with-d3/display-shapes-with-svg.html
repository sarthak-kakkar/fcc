<!--
  The last challenge created an svg element with a given width and height, which was visible because it had a background-color applied to it in the style tag. 
  The code made space for the given width and height.

The next step is to create a shape to put in the svg area. 
There are a number of supported shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. 
They are used to display data. For example, a rectangle (<rect>) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.

When you place a shape into the svg area, you can specify where it goes with x and y coordinates. 
The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. 
Positive values for x push the shape to the right, and positive values for y push the shape down from the origin point.
