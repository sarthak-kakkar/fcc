<!--
  SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
  
  Here "scalable" means that, if you zoom in or out on an object, it would not appear pixelated. 
  It scales with the display system, whether it's on a small mobile screen or a large TV monitor.
  
  SVG is used to make common geometric shapes. Since D3 maps data into a visual representation, it uses SVG to create the shapes for the visualization. 
  SVG shapes for a web page must go within an HTML svg tag.
  
  CSS can be scalable when styles use relative units (such as vh, vw, or percentages), but using SVG is more flexible to build data visualizations.
