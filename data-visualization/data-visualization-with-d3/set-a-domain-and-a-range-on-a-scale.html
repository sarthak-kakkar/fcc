<!--
  By default, scales use the identity relationship. This means the input value maps to the output value. 
  However, scales can be much more flexible and interesting.

Say a dataset has values ranging from 50 to 480. 
This is the input information for a scale, also known as the domain.

You want to map those points along the x axis on the SVG canvas, between 10 units and 500 units. 
This is the output information, also known as the range.

The domain() and range() methods set these values for the scale. 
Both methods take an array of at least two elements as an argument.

Here's an example:

// Set a domain
// The domain covers the set of input values
scale.domain([50, 480]);
// Set a range
// The range covers the set of output values
scale.range([10, 500]);
scale(50) // Returns 10
scale(480) // Returns 500
scale(325) // Returns 323.37
scale(750) // Returns 807.67
d3.scaleLinear()

Notice that the scale uses the linear relationship between the domain and range values to figure out what the output should be for a given number. 
The minimum value in the domain (50) maps to the minimum value (10) in the range.
