The Node Package Manager (npm) is a command-line tool used by developers to share and control modules (or packages) of JavaScript code written for use with Node.js.

When starting a new project, npm generates a package.json file. This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.

npm saves packages in a folder named node_modules. These packages can be installed in two ways:

- globally in a root node_modules folder, accessible by all projects.
- locally within a project's own node_modules folder, accessible only to that project.

Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.

"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.

In the last challenge, you told npm to only include a specific version of a package. That’s a useful way to freeze your dependencies if you need to make sure that different parts of your project stay compatible with each other. But in most use cases, you don’t want to miss bug fixes since they often include important security patches and (hopefully) don’t break things in doing so.

To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character. Here's an example of how to allow updates to any 1.3.x version.

"package": "~1.3.8"

Similar to how the tilde we learned about in the last challenge allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency, the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.

Your current version of moment should be "~2.10.2" which allows npm to install to the latest 2.10.x version. If you were to use the caret (^) as a version prefix instead, npm would be allowed to update to any 2.x.x version.

"package": "^1.3.8"
This would allow updates to any 1.x.x version of the package.
