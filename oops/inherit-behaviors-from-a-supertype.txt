function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }

// Only change code below this line

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line

/*
let animal = new Animal();

There are some disadvantages when using this syntax for inheritance, which are too complex for the scope of this challenge. Instead, here's an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype); 

Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be Animal's prototype, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.
