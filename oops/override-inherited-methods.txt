/*
If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on duckâ€™s prototype chain:

duck => Is eat() defined here? No.
Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.
Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
